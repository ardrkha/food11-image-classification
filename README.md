# Food-11 Image Classification

This project is an image classification project of 16000+ food images consisting of 11 types of food. This project is used to complete the "Belajar Pengembangan Machine Learning" course on the Dicoding platform.



## Dataset
The dataset used is a dataset from Kaggle with the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trolukovich/food11-image-dataset

This dataset contains 16643 food images grouped in 11 major food categories. However, I modified the dataset by combining all training, validation, and test files into one for each class so that I could split the data according to the ratio I wanted.

This dataset contains 11 categories of food:
- Bread
- Dairy product
- Dessert
- Egg
- Fried food
- Meat
- Noodles-Pasta
- Rice
- Seafood
- Soup
- Vegetable-Fruit

1. Create Environment
```bash

```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Open and run the notebook:
- Use Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to open the `notebook.ipynb` file.
- Run all cells to train the model.
